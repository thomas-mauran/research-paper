% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the field of astronomy has witnessed a growing collaboration between amateur 
and professional astronomers. The advent of high-quality, low-cost equipment has enabled 
amateur astronomers to perform sophisticated observations, including photometric studies of 
binary star transits. This paper focuses on photometric observations of the U Cephei 
(U Cephei) binary star system conducted by the author using personal equipment from a 
Bortle 7 location. The study aims to examine the precision and reliability of these amateur 
observations in comparison to professional datasets, exploring the potential for collaboration
and the challenges inherent in combining data from diverse sources.

\section{State of the Art}
The field of photometric observation has witnessed significant advancements due to improvements in both professional and amateur technologies. 

\section{What are transits?}

Transits are a phenomenon that occurs when a celestial body passes in front of another, partially or totally blocking its light.
Those events are very interesting for astronomers as they can provide a lot of information about the objects involved, such as their size, mass, and even atmosphere.

The first exoplanet was discovered using the transit method, and it's still one of the most used methods to detect exoplanets.
One of the way to know if a star is part of a binary system is to observe it and see if it's light intensity varies over time, which can be a sign of a transit event.

\section{On the U Cephei system}

U Cephei is a very interesting binary star system and a great pick to try catching transit eclipses. 

\subsection{Why U Cephei?}

There are multiple reasons why U Cephei is a great candidate for me in this study.

\subsubsection{Period}

First of all U Cephei period is 2.493 days, which is quite short and allows for multiple chances to observe it on a short period of time. 
Even though this period seems short since it's not exactly 3 days but 2 and a half it means that one observation out of 2 will be at night and the other during the day.
Making observation nights possible every 5 days.
Considering the fact weather conditions are critical for this field, managing to have a night with good seeing condition can also be a challenge, so having multiple chances to observe the same system is a great advantage.

\subsubsection{Eclipse duration}

Secondly, this system eclipse is short, lasting only a couple of hours it's possible in one night to observe the complete eclipse, which is not the case for all binary systems.

\subsubsection{Magnitude variation}

Stars magnitude define how bright they are. This scale of magnitude is logarithmic, meaning that a difference of 1 magnitude is a difference of 2.512 times in brightness and a difference of 2 magnitudes is a difference of \(\mathbf{2.512^2}\) times in brightness.
the scale is inverted, meaning that the lower the magnitude, the brighter the star is.

The magnitude of U Cephei varies from 6.7 to 9.2. Which is actually a huge variation in brightness. If we wanna have a comparaison in percentage we can do the following calculation:

We can right the magnitude variation as a ratio of brightness variation:

\begin{equation}
     2.512^{m_2-m_1} = \frac{F_1}{F_2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    2.512^{9.2-6.7} \approx 10
\end{equation}

In other words, during the transit, U Cephei will be 10 times less bright than when it's not in transit. This is a huge variation and makes it easier to detect the transit.

\subsubsection{Data availability}

Finally, U Cephei is a well-known system, with a lot of data available from professional observatories, which makes it a great candidate for me as an amateur astronomer to try to catch some transits and compare my data to the professional ones.

% Methodology
\section{Methodology}
To address the research question, this study employs a comparative analysis of photometric data. Observations of the U Cephei binary star system were conducted using personal equipment under urban light pollution conditions (Bortle 7). The following steps were undertaken:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setup of observation equipment, including a CCD camera and a telescope with an aperture suitable for photometric studies.
    \item Observation of the U Cephei binary system taking 15 second exposure every 2 minutes.
    \item Acquisition of professional data on U Cephei from observatory archives and published studies for comparison.
    \item Standardization of data formats for comparative analysis.
    \item Statistical evaluation of precision, including signal-to-noise ratios and error margins.
    \item Reliability assessment through consistency checks and cross-validation with established models.
\end{enumerate}

% Equipment
\section{equipment}
Specifying the equipment used in the study is essential to understanding the context and limitations of the observations. 
I employed the following equipment for the photometric observations of U Cephei:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Telescope: Sky-Watcher Quattro 150P Newtonian reflector telescope with a 150mm aperture and 600mm focal length.
    \item Reducer: Sky-Watcher 0.85x Coma Corrector lowering the focal length to 510mm.
    \item Camera: ZWO ASI 585MC pro monochrome CCD camera with a 8.29 MP sensor.
    \item Filters: UV and IR cut filter for reducing light pollution and enhancing contrast.
    \item Mount: Celestron Celestrong cg-5 goto equatorial mount for tracking and guiding.
    \item Software: N.I.N.A for image acquisition and PHD2 guiding software for tracking. AstroImageJ for data analysis.
    \item Light Pollution: Montpellier, Bortle 7 (suburban/urban transition) location with moderate light pollution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The analysis reveals both strengths and limitations in the amateur photometric observations of U Cephei:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amateur data demonstrated significant precision in detecting transit features, with signal-to-noise ratios that were competitive with professional datasets under optimal conditions.
    \item Light pollution and equipment limitations introduced variability, leading to slightly higher error margins compared to professional datasets.
    \item Cross-validation with professional data confirmed the overall reliability of the amateur observations, with minor deviations attributed to observational conditions.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
% The findings underscore the feasibility of conducting meaningful photometric observations of binary star systems, such as U Cephei, under suboptimal conditions using personal equipment. While light pollution (Bortle 7) posed challenges, careful calibration and consistent methodology mitigated many of the issues. The results demonstrate the potential for amateur observations to complement professional studies, particularly for systems with frequent or well-documented transits.

% This study highlights the potential of amateur astronomers to contribute to the broader astronomical community. By focusing on specific systems like U Cephei, amateurs can provide valuable data to supplement professional observations. Future efforts should aim to enhance equipment calibration techniques and explore automated tools for improving data reliability.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
The personal photometric observations of U Cephei conducted in this study illustrate the potential for amateur astronomers to achieve a high degree of precision, even in light-polluted environments. These observations, while slightly less precise than professional datasets, offer valuable insights and demonstrate the viability of citizen science in advancing binary star research. Further research should focus on refining techniques and fostering collaborative efforts between amateur and professional astronomers to maximize the scientific value of such observations.

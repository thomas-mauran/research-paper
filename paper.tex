% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the field of astronomy has witnessed a growing collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. The advent of high-quality, low-cost equipment has enabled amateur astronomers to perform sophisticated observations, including photometric studies of binary star transits. This paper focuses on photometric observations of the U Cepheihei (U Cephei) binary star system conducted by the author using personal equipment from a Bortle 7 location. The study aims to examine the precision and reliability of these amateur observations in comparison to professional datasets, exploring the potential for collaboration and the challenges inherent in combining data from diverse sources.

% Methodology
\section{Methodology}
To address the research question, this study employs a comparative analysis of photometric data. Observations of the U Cephei binary star system were conducted using personal equipment under urban light pollution conditions (Bortle 7). The following steps were undertaken:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setup of observation equipment, including a CCD camera and a telescope with an aperture suitable for photometric studies.
    \item Observation of the U Cephei binary system taking 15 second exposure every 2 minutes.
    \item Acquisition of professional data on U Cephei from observatory archives and published studies for comparison.
    \item Standardization of data formats for comparative analysis.
    \item Statistical evaluation of precision, including signal-to-noise ratios and error margins.
    \item Reliability assessment through consistency checks and cross-validation with established models.
\end{enumerate}

% Equipment
\section{equipment}
Specifying the equipment used in the study is essential to understanding the context and limitations of the observations. 
I employed the following equipment for the photometric observations of U Cephei:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Telescope: Sky-Watcher Quattro 150P Newtonian reflector telescope with a 150mm aperture and 600mm focal length.
    \item Reducer: Sky-Watcher 0.85x Coma Corrector lowering the focal length to 510mm.
    \item Camera: ZWO ASI 585MC pro monochrome CCD camera with a 8.29 MP sensor.
    \item Filters: UV and IR cut filter for reducing light pollution and enhancing contrast.
    \item Mount: Celestron Celestrong cg-5 goto equatorial mount for tracking and guiding.
    \item Software: N.I.N.A for image acquisition and PHD2 guiding software for tracking. AstroImageJ for data analysis.
    \item Light Pollution: Montpellier, Bortle 7 (suburban/urban transition) location with moderate light pollution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The analysis reveals both strengths and limitations in the amateur photometric observations of U Cephei:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amateur data demonstrated significant precision in detecting transit features, with signal-to-noise ratios that were competitive with professional datasets under optimal conditions.
    \item Light pollution and equipment limitations introduced variability, leading to slightly higher error margins compared to professional datasets.
    \item Cross-validation with professional data confirmed the overall reliability of the amateur observations, with minor deviations attributed to observational conditions.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
% The findings underscore the feasibility of conducting meaningful photometric observations of binary star systems, such as U Cephei, under suboptimal conditions using personal equipment. While light pollution (Bortle 7) posed challenges, careful calibration and consistent methodology mitigated many of the issues. The results demonstrate the potential for amateur observations to complement professional studies, particularly for systems with frequent or well-documented transits.

% This study highlights the potential of amateur astronomers to contribute to the broader astronomical community. By focusing on specific systems like U Cephei, amateurs can provide valuable data to supplement professional observations. Future efforts should aim to enhance equipment calibration techniques and explore automated tools for improving data reliability.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
The personal photometric observations of U Cephei conducted in this study illustrate the potential for amateur astronomers to achieve a high degree of precision, even in light-polluted environments. These observations, while slightly less precise than professional datasets, offer valuable insights and demonstrate the viability of citizen science in advancing binary star research. Further research should focus on refining techniques and fostering collaborative efforts between amateur and professional astronomers to maximize the scientific value of such observations.
